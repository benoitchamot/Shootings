                    <ul>
                        <li>To better understand the factors affecting the risks of an individual committing a mass shooting</li>
                        <li>To assess criteria to be used in firearms license background checks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Who is this tool for?</h2>
                    <p>This tool can be used by individuals interested in firearms, gun shop owners or regulators, among others.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What is OpenBox?</h2>
                    <p>OpenBox is our simplest model. It looks only at a small set of variables
                        to determine the risk caused by a certain individual.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>What is BlackBox?</h2>
                    <p>BlackBox is a more complex model that uses Machine Learning (ML) to determine
                        whether an individual poses a risk or not. It looks at a more extensive set 
                        of variables. Its name comes from the fact that it is less straightforward to 
                        understand the impact of one specifc variable on the overall risk.
                    </p>
